        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Bangalore has a rich history that dates back to the 16th century. The city was a stronghold of several South
            Indian dynasties, including the Vijayanagara Empire and the Keladi Nayaka Kingdom. In the 18th century,
            Bangalore became a part of the British East India Company, and it was during this time that the city began
            to grow and develop as a modern city.</p>
